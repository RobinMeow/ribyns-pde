- move ascii art to .config/nvim/ folder i think (reduce git repo deps)
- https://github.com/folke/flash.nvim

Deferred:
- rove ascii art (didnt look so good. no good fanart)
- instead of using fortune it would be cool to have 97 things every programmer should know (their titles) as reminders
- transparent background in neovim?
