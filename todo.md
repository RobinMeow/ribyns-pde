- yazi / fzf / oil some sort of file manager https://github.com/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim

- https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim
- Keybind for folding methods in csharp with and without namespaces maybe also for ts? or keybinds like vs code, based on indent level

# low prio

- nvim restore previous session `:mksession filename.vim` and load with `nvim -S filename.vim`. doesnt work for quick fix list. so a plugin is probably worthline. perfeable one which supports different nvim workspaces
_ consider hand written workspice files in lua. BUt for that I wanna collect more lua experience
- markdown viewer? https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim not sure if i need sth like that
- Debugging in nvim? not sure if i care about this. im fine with using windows for debugging for now.
- database access from within nvim devries way i liked https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALGBuFLzDSA dadbob?
- stay up 2 date on kickstarter commits to see i want to take those changes e.g. https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/commit/21d5aabc22ac44fc9404953a0b77944879465dd0
- instead of using fortune it would be cool to have 97 things every programmer should know (their titles) as reminders
- add a shell cript for cloning this repo with installation instruction in readme

## Explicitly-Discarded

- terminal based browser wont do my ant good
- rove ascii art (didnt look so good. no good fanart)
