hi chatgpt, i noticed that some applictions i use dependon KDE/Plasma. which is okay for now. but in the future when i swap from nvidia to amd gpu i want to use hyperland instead. i know i could still use the kde apps, but i dont really like kde. so i would prefer to use the most common apps by users who use arch + hyperland :) please keep your answers short and consice.
